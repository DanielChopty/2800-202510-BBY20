      <h5>Dedication <span class="emoji">üí™</span></h5>
      <p>
        We don't walk away from a problem just because it's tough. If something is buggy or not working, we keep at it until it is solid. Deadlines and quality matter, so we always try and do our work the best way possible. Whether it's a team activity or solo late-night coding, we're here to finish what we start.

      <h5>Creativity <span class="emoji">üé®</span></h5>
      <p>
        For us, creativity shows up in clean code and smart solutions. We like finding better ways of doing things. Whether that's simplifying a messy function or designing a smoother user flow. We enjoy the process of exploring and iterating for a better end product.

      <h5>Teamwork <span class="emoji">ü§ù</span></h5>
      <p>
        We're not just teammates, we're problem solvers who are always determined to find the best fix possible. Everyone brings different strengths to the table. We keep things open, honest and supportive. At the end of the day, good teamwork translates to a better codebase.

      <h2 class="mb-3">Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is simple: make an app that connects citizens and city officials by providing an interactive platform 
        for one-click polls and feedback on local projects. 
        Citizens' voices need to be heard, and this app will amplify those voices, making them an integral part of 
        shaping a city's future.
